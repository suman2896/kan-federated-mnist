This repository contains a complete implementation of Federated Learning using Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KAN) on the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates how to combine privacy-preserving model training with interpretable deep learning by replacing traditional activation functions with learnable B-spline interpolations.
